          History of JavaScript
        </h1>

        <p className="text-gray-300 mb-4">
          JavaScript was created in 1995 by <strong>Brendan Eich</strong> while
          he was working at Netscape. It was originally called <em>Mocha</em>,
          briefly renamed to <em>LiveScript</em>, and finally became{" "}
          <em>JavaScript</em>.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-white mt-6 mb-2">
          Why the Name “JavaScript”?
        </h2>
        <p className="text-gray-300 mb-4">
          Despite the name, JavaScript has{" "}
          <strong>nothing to do with Java</strong> in terms of design. Netscape
          partnered with Sun Microsystems (creators of Java) to promote the
          language and named it “JavaScript” to ride the hype around Java in the
          mid-90s.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-300 mb-4">
          This marketing decision caused confusion for years, but JavaScript and
          Java are as different as car and carpet.
        </p>

          Why It Matters

          Knowing the history and naming confusion helps understand JavaScript’s
          ecosystem, rapid growth, and its role as the core language of the web.
